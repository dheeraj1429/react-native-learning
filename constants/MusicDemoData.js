One of Ireland's most well-known folk songs represents Irish independence.

The lyrics exhort Irishmen to stand up and fight for their land: "And righteous men must make our land a nation once again." In 1972, Wolf Tones re-recorded this song, and it was voted the world's most famous song by listeners to the BBC World Service.`,
